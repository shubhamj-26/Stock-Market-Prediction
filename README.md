### Stock Market Prediction Project

This project, developed as a final year project, focuses on predicting stock prices using machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to build a model that forecasts the prices of stocks for various companies on a given date. The web application displays a list of companies with their predicted stock prices, providing valuable insights for investors and enthusiasts.

## üèÅ Project Details <a name="project_details"></a>

- **Duration:** Approximately 6 months
- **Team Size:** 4 members
- **Role:** Team Leader, Front-End Development

### Purpose

The main objective of the project was to develop a predictive model for stock prices using machine learning. We employed the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm for accurate predictions. The web application showcases a list of companies, each with its predicted stock price on a specified date.

### Data Generation

- **Datasets:** Generated using Jupyter-notebook and the Yahoo Finance library.
- **Tweet Display:** Integrated tweets about stocks using the Tweepy library.

### Architecture

- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Back-End:** Flask Framework
- **Database:** Not used; datasets generated dynamically
